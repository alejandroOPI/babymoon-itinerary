The apartment is in the 9th, that perfect Parisian neighborhood that tourists rarely find—far enough from the crowds to feel like a secret, close enough to everything to feel like the center of the world.</p>
            
            <p>The first day is for recovery. For walking slowly through unfamiliar streets, for finding the corner café that will become ours, for remembering how to breathe in a different rhythm.</p>

Then across the river to the <strong>Orangerie</strong>, where Monet's Water Lilies wrap around us like a meditation. Walk through the Tuileries in the gray winter light, then lose ourselves in Saint-Germain for dinner.</p>

            <p>Venice in January is Venice without the crowds—a city returned to itself. The light is different in winter: softer, more forgiving, turning every canal into a mirror and every building into a watercolor. We're staying in Dorsoduro, the quietest of the central sestieri, where the Accademia and Guggenheim are neighbors and the views across to the Giudecca make evening walks feel like stepping into a Canaletto.</p>
            
            <p>Il Palazzo Experimental is the kind of hotel that feels like a discovery—design-forward but warm, stylish but not trying too hard. The kind of place where breakfast becomes an event and the bar becomes a ritual.</p>

            <p>We land at Marco Polo just before noon. The water taxi will be extravagant and worth it—approaching Venice by water is the only proper introduction. Afternoon to settle in, perhaps a first visit to the <strong>Accademia</strong> if energy permits, then an easy dinner in the neighborhood.</p>

            <p>Milan is not a city that reveals itself easily. It lacks the obvious beauty of Rome or Florence, the romance of Venice, the glamour of the Riviera.

            <p>Travel from Wengen via Interlaken. Check in early afternoon, then the Old Town loop: <strong>Chapel Bridge</strong>, the squares, the lakefront, the Lion Monument if we're feeling sentimental. Lakeside dinner.</p>

            <p>Vals is a pilgrimage. Not for everyone, but for those who care about architecture, about thermal water, about the idea that a building can be transcendent—Vals is essential. Peter Zumthor's Therme Vals is widely considered one of the greatest buildings of the twentieth century: 60,000 slabs of local quartzite forming spaces for water, light, and silence.</p>
