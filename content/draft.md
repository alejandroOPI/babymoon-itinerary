# Babymoon 2026: A Journey Through Europe

*January 5 – February 8, 2026*
*Alejandro & Alejandra*

---

## The Journey

Thirty-five days. Four countries. One last great adventure before everything changes.

This is not a vacation—it's a pilgrimage. Through the light of Paris in winter, the impossible reflections of Venice, the snow-capped silence of the Dolomites, the design temples of Milan, the thermal waters of Vals. Each stop chosen with intention. Each day a gift.

---

## Part One: Paris
*January 6–9 · 3 nights*
*2 Rue Moncey, 9th arrondissement*

We arrive in Paris in the blue hour of a January afternoon, jet-lagged and giddy, the city spreading out beneath the plane like a map of promises. The apartment is in the 9th, that perfect Parisian neighborhood that tourists rarely find—far enough from the crowds to feel like a secret, close enough to everything to feel like the center of the world.

The first day is for recovery. For walking slowly through unfamiliar streets, for finding the corner café that will become ours, for remembering how to breathe in a different rhythm.

### The Days

**January 7 · Wednesday**
Morning at the Maison Européenne de la Photographie—three floors of images that will change how we see. Then across the river to the Orangerie, where Monet's Water Lilies wrap around us like a meditation. We'll walk through the Tuileries in the gray winter light, then lose ourselves in Saint-Germain for dinner.

*Shopping notes: UNIQLO for basics, Lemaire for something beautiful, Merci for gifts we'll pretend are for others.*

**January 8 · Thursday**
A free morning. Perhaps the Marais, perhaps nothing at all. We leave for Venice tomorrow.

---

## Part Two: Venice
*January 9–13 · 4 nights*
*Il Palazzo Experimental, Dorsoduro 1411*

Venice in January is Venice without the crowds—a city returned to itself. The light is different in winter: softer, more forgiving, turning every canal into a mirror and every building into a watercolor. We're staying in Dorsoduro, the quietest of the central sestieri, where the Accademia and Guggenheim are neighbors and the views across to the Giudecca make evening walks feel like stepping into a Canaletto.

Il Palazzo Experimental is the kind of hotel that feels like a discovery—design-forward but warm, stylish but not trying too hard. The kind of place where breakfast becomes an event and the bar becomes a ritual.

### The Days

**January 9 · Friday**
We land at Marco Polo just before noon. The water taxi will be extravagant and worth it—approaching Venice by water is the only proper introduction. Afternoon to settle in, perhaps a first visit to the Accademia if energy permits, then an easy dinner in the neighborhood.

**January 10 · Saturday**
Art immersion day. Morning at the Gallerie dell'Accademia—Bellini, Titian, Tintoretto, Veronese, the whole Venetian pantheon. Afternoon at the Peggy Guggenheim Collection, then Punta della Dogana for the contemporary counterpoint. Evening aperitivo somewhere with a view.

**January 11 · Sunday**
The classics: St. Mark's Basilica (check Sunday hours), the Doge's Palace, then wandering through the Arsenale and Biennale district. Late afternoon through San Polo to Rialto, then the Line 1 vaporetto at sunset—the Grand Canal gilded and glowing.

**January 12 · Monday**
Islands day. Murano in the morning to watch glass being shaped by fire. Burano in the afternoon for lunch among the colored houses. Back to Venice for a farewell dinner—Osteria da Fiore if we can get in, Antiche Carampane if we can't, Alle Testiere if we're lucky.

---

## Part Three: The Dolomites
*January 13–17 · 4 nights*

### Cortina d'Ampezzo
*January 13–15 · 2 nights*
*Rosapetra SPA Resort, Zuel di Sopra 1*

From the canals of Venice to the peaks of the Dolomites—a journey from water to stone, from Renaissance to sublime. Cortina is the queen of the Dolomites, a town that somehow manages to be both glamorous and genuine, where ski lifts and Aperol Spritz coexist with serious alpinism and ancient mountain culture.

The Rosapetra is our base for the first two nights—a spa resort where the mountains fill every window and the thermal pools offer the kind of warmth that seeps into your bones and stays there.

### Alpe di Siusi
*January 15–17 · 2 nights*
*COMO Alpina Dolomites, Compatsch 62/3*

Then we move to Alpe di Siusi—Europe's largest alpine meadow, a high plateau of impossible beauty where the Sassolungo and Sciliar peaks rise like cathedrals of rock. The COMO Alpina is the kind of hotel that makes you want to cancel the rest of your trip and just stay. Mountain modern design, wellness programs that actually work, and views that make you understand why people spend their lives chasing mountains.

### The Days

**January 13 · Tuesday**
Travel from Venice to Cortina. The train winds through the foothills, the Dolomites growing in the windows until they fill the sky. Check-in, first spa session, early dinner. The mountains will still be there tomorrow.

**January 14 · Wednesday**
A spa day with options. Morning in the thermal pools, afternoon for a gentle winter walk or simply reading by the fire. This is the Dolomites in rest mode—letting the landscape do the work.

**January 15 · Thursday**
Transfer to Alpe di Siusi. The drive climbs through pine forests and emerges onto the plateau like entering another world. Afternoon to explore the meadow—by foot, by sled, by simply standing still and looking. First dinner at the COMO.

**January 16 · Friday**
Mountain day. Winter hiking to a rifugio for lunch—those mountain huts where they serve polenta and speck and wine that tastes better than anything in the valley. Back for spa, dinner, and the last night in the Dolomites.

**January 17 · Saturday**
One more spa session, then the long train to Milan. We'll arrive by evening and maybe, if we have energy, visit Pirelli HangarBicocca—that vast industrial cathedral of contemporary art, free and open late on Saturdays.

---

## Part Four: Milan
*January 17–22 · 5 nights*
*Corso di Porta Ticinese, 12*

Milan is not a city that reveals itself easily. It lacks the obvious beauty of Rome or Florence, the romance of Venice, the glamour of the Riviera. What it has instead is something rarer: a kind of sophisticated intensity, a city where design and industry and fashion and art have fused into something uniquely Milanese.

We're staying in Ticinese, the neighborhood that feels most like the Milan of the Milanese—the Navigli canals, the vintage shops, the aperitivo bars that haven't been discovered by Instagram yet.

### The Days

**January 18 · Sunday**
Pinacoteca di Brera in the morning—one of Italy's great collections, in a building that feels like a Renaissance palace because it was one. Then the Duomo: the roof terraces first (book tickets), then the interior, then the design district around. Evening in Brera for aperitivo and dinner.

**January 19 · Monday**
Contemporary Milan. Fondazione Prada in the morning—Rem Koolhaas's architectural masterpiece, housing Miuccia Prada's impeccable collection. Lunch at Bar Luce, Wes Anderson's candy-colored café. Afternoon wandering through Porta Nuova and the Bosco Verticale—Milan's vertical forest, the buildings that proved sustainability could be beautiful. Dinner in Isola.

**January 20 · Tuesday**
The Last Supper. Fifteen minutes in front of Leonardo's masterpiece—booked months ago, because this is how it works. Then Corso Magenta and the design district, 10 Corso Como for the shop that started it all.

**January 21 · Wednesday**
Flexible day. Castello Sforzesco if we want more art, Museo del Novecento if we want more modernism, Navigli canals if we want to just walk. Shopping in the Quadrilatero if we want to dream. Pack for Como.

**January 22 · Thursday**
Lake Como day trip. Train to Varenna first (one hour, beautiful), then ferry to Bellagio for lunch, then Como town. The Brunate funicular at sunset if timing works. One night at Hotel Villa Flori—a villa on the lake, the kind of place that makes you understand why everyone from Pliny to Clooney has fallen for Como.

---

## Part Five: Switzerland
*January 23 – February 1 · 9 nights*

### Wengen
*January 23–26 · 3 nights*
*Airbnb in the village*

From Italy to Switzerland by train—one of Europe's great scenic journeys, through Lugano and Lucerne and up into the Bernese Oberland. Wengen is a car-free village perched on a sunny terrace above the Lauterbrunnen Valley, facing the holy trinity of Alps: Eiger, Mönch, Jungfrau.

### The Days

**January 23 · Friday**
The journey is the destination. Como to Lugano to Lucerne to Interlaken to Lauterbrunnen to Wengen—five or six hours of lakes and mountains and tunnels and bridges. Arrive mid-afternoon, check in, walk the village, find the view from our balcony.

**January 24 · Saturday**
Mountain day, weather permitting. Jungfraujoch is the famous one—the highest railway station in Europe, a tourist machine, but earned. Männlichen is the alternative—easier, quieter, with hiking even in winter.

**January 25 · Sunday**
Buffer day. If the weather was bad yesterday, this is mountain day. If it was good, this is recovery day—Lauterbrunnen Valley for the waterfalls, Mürren for another car-free village, or simply staying in Wengen with a book.

### Lucerne
*January 26–28 · 2 nights*
*AMERON Luzern Hotel Flora, Seidenhofstrasse 5*

Lucerne is Switzerland's postcard—the Chapel Bridge, the lake, the mountains rising behind. But it's also a real city, with serious culture (the Rosengart Collection is world-class) and access to some of the country's best day trips.

### The Days

**January 26 · Monday**
Travel from Wengen via Interlaken. Check in early afternoon, then the Old Town loop: Chapel Bridge, the squares, the lakefront, the Lion Monument if we're feeling sentimental. Lakeside dinner.

**January 27 · Tuesday**
Mt. Rigi day. Boat from Lucerne to Vitznau—one hour of pure lake pleasure. Then the cogwheel train to Rigi Kulm, where the views stretch to infinity. Lunch on the mountain, descent via Weggis, boat back. Evening at the Rosengart Collection or just walking by the lake.

### Vals
*January 28–30 · 2 nights*
*7132 House of Architects, Poststrasse 560*

Vals is a pilgrimage. Not for everyone, but for those who care about architecture, about thermal water, about the idea that a building can be transcendent—Vals is essential. Peter Zumthor's Therme Vals is widely considered one of the greatest buildings of the twentieth century: 60,000 slabs of local quartzite forming spaces for water, light, and silence.

The 7132 Hotel is built around the Therme. We'll have access to the baths before and after the public hours—those quiet moments when the water and stone and steam are ours alone.

### The Days

**January 28 · Wednesday**
The journey to Vals. The Gotthard Panorama train from Lucerne through Andermatt and over the Oberalp Pass—sit on the right side for the Rhine Gorge. Then the PostBus from Chur through the narrow valley to Vals. Check in. First Therme session. Dinner.

**January 29 · Thursday**
Full Therme day. Early morning in the baths before anyone else. Slow breakfast. Walk the village (it takes fifteen minutes). Second Therme session. Read. Third session in the evening. Dinner. This is a day for letting time dissolve.

### Basel & Zürich
*January 30–31 · 2 nights*
*Basel: Volkshaus Basel · Zürich: B2 Hotel*

Basel is Switzerland's art city—Fondation Beyeler, Kunstmuseum, Vitra Design Museum just across the border in Germany. Zürich is the financial capital, but also home to the Kunsthaus and the Fraumünster's Chagall windows.

### The Days

**January 30 · Friday**
One more Therme session, then bus and train to Basel. Afternoon in the Altstadt: the Münster, the Marktplatz, the Rhine promenade. Check in at Volkshaus. Early dinner and rest.

**January 31 · Saturday**
Museum marathon. Morning at the Vitra Design Museum campus in Weil am Rhein—take the architecture tour if you can. Afternoon at Fondation Beyeler—allow at least three hours. Train to Zürich, check in, simple dinner.

**February 1 · Sunday**
Quick Zürich morning: Fraumünster for Chagall's stained glass windows, Old Town, maybe the lake. Then the airport. Flight to London.

---

## Part Six: London
*February 1–7 · 6 nights*
*Accommodation TBD*

London is the finale—a city we know, a language we share, a chance to exhale after weeks of European intensity. The plan here is looser: great museums (free!), great food (not free), great walking, great theater if something's on.

### The Days

**February 2 · Monday**
South Bank day. Tate Modern in the morning—plan three or four hours. Then walk along the river: Shakespeare's Globe, Borough Market for lunch and wandering, maybe the Southbank Centre.

**February 3 · Tuesday**
South Kensington day. V&A in the morning—the Cast Courts, the Fashion galleries, the jewelry. Design Museum in the afternoon.

**February 4 · Wednesday**
British Museum day. Morning in Bloomsbury with the Rosetta Stone and the Elgin Marbles and everything else. Afternoon in East London: Brick Lane, Shoreditch, the street art, the curry.

**February 5 · Thursday**
Shopping day. Dover Street Market for fashion-as-art. Liberty for the building and the prints. Covent Garden for the crowd-watching. Afternoon tea somewhere proper—Sketch, Claridge's, The Wolseley—book ahead.

**February 6 · Friday**
Notting Hill and farewell. Portobello Road in the morning. Final shopping, final packing, afternoon tea if we missed it. Farewell dinner somewhere meaningful—Dishoom for the nostalgia, Hawksmoor for the meat, Bao for the buns. Flight home at 22:30.

---

## The Return
*February 7–8*

The overnight flight. Mexico City in the morning. Home.

Thirty-five days. Four countries. One last great adventure before everything changes.

And then: everything changes.
