            <p>Thirty-five days. Four countries. Twelve beds. One last great adventure before everything changes.</p>
            
            <p>This is not a vacation. It's a pilgrimage—through the light of Paris in winter, the impossible stillness of Venice before the crowds, the snow-capped silence of the Dolomites, the design temples of Milan, the thermal waters of a Swiss valley so remote it feels like the edge of the world. We end in London, a city we know, a language we share, a gentle landing before the flight home.</p>
            
            <p>We leave Mexico City on January 5th. We return on February 8th. In between: everything.</p>

            <div class="prose">
                <p>We land at Charles de Gaulle in the blue hour of a January afternoon, that particular Parisian twilight that painters have been chasing for centuries. The taxi winds through the périphérique as the city reveals itself in fragments: the Sacré-Cœur glowing white on its hill, the Seine curving beneath bridges we'll walk across tomorrow, the apartment blocks with their zinc roofs and wrought-iron balconies, each window a small theater of French life.</p>

                <p>Our apartment is in the 9th arrondissement, on a street called Rue Moncey. Not the Paris of postcards—no Eiffel Tower views, no Marais cobblestones—but the Paris of Parisians. The neighborhood of Pigalle and the Folies Bergère, of corner bakeries that have been making the same croissants for three generations, of wine bars where nobody speaks English because nobody needs to. This is where we'll learn to breathe in a different rhythm.</p>

            <div class="prose">
                <p>The first day is for recovery—that particular jet-lag state where everything feels slightly unreal, like walking through a film you've seen before. We'll find a café that becomes ours, order café crèmes and watch the neighborhood wake up, let the city come to us rather than chasing it.</p>

                <p>But by Wednesday, we're ready. The <strong>Maison Européenne de la Photographie</strong> first—three floors of images in a Marais mansion, one of Europe's great photography museums and almost unknown to tourists. Then across the river to the <strong>Musée de l'Orangerie</strong>, that small temple built specifically to house Monet's water lilies. Eight panels. Two oval rooms. The closest thing to meditation you can find in a museum. We'll sit there until the guards politely suggest we move on.</p>

                <p>Afternoon in the Tuileries, even in January. The gardens will be bare, the fountains still, the chairs stacked against the cold—but there's something perfect about Paris in its dormant season. The light is gentler. The crowds are gone. The city belongs to the people who live there.</p>

                <p>Dinner in Saint-Germain, because some clichés exist for a reason. We don't need to plan it. We'll walk until somewhere feels right.</p>

            <div class="prose">
                <p>Venice in January is a secret the city keeps from summer tourists. The cruise ships are gone. The gelato stands are shuttered. The acqua alta may flood the piazzas, but that's part of the magic—watching Venetians in rubber boots wade through St. Mark's Square like it's the most normal thing in the world, because to them it is.</p>

                <p>We're staying in Dorsoduro, the quiet belly of the city, where the Accademia and the Guggenheim are neighbors and the views across the Giudecca Canal make every sunset feel like a gift you didn't deserve. Our hotel is the <strong>Il Palazzo Experimental</strong>—a 16th-century palazzo reimagined by Dorothée Meilichzon, the designer who made the Experimental Group the most interesting hotel company in Europe. Terrazzo floors. Murano glass. A bar that serves better Negronis than most places in Milan.</p>

                <p>We'll spend four nights here, which sounds like a lot for a city you can walk across in an hour. But Venice doesn't work that way. Venice is not a city to see—it's a city to get lost in, to let swallow you whole, to surrender to until you stop trying to understand it and just exist inside it.</p>

            <div class="prose">
                <p>Saturday is for the Venetians—the ones who painted, the ones who collected. Morning at the <strong>Gallerie dell'Accademia</strong>: Bellini's altarpieces glowing with that impossible light, Giorgione's "Tempest" still mysterious after five hundred years, Veronese's "Feast in the House of Levi" so scandalous the Inquisition made him change the title. Afternoon at the <strong>Peggy Guggenheim Collection</strong>, that palazzo on the Grand Canal where an American heiress built one of the great modern art collections while scandalizing Venetian society and sleeping with most of the artists.</p>

                <p>Sunday we do the things you're supposed to do: St. Mark's Basilica, the Doge's Palace, the Bridge of Sighs. But we'll do them early, before the day-trippers arrive, when the mosaics catch the morning light and the palace feels like what it was—the seat of an empire that ruled the Mediterranean for a thousand years.</p>

                <p>And on Monday, the islands. <strong>Murano</strong> first, to watch glassblowers do what their families have done since the 13th century, when the furnaces were banished from Venice proper because they kept burning the city down. Then <strong>Burano</strong>, that fishing village where every house is painted a different color—originally so fishermen could find their way home through the fog, now so tourists can fill their Instagram feeds. We'll have lunch there, at some trattoria that serves whatever came out of the lagoon that morning, and we won't look at our phones once.</p>

                <p>Tuesday morning, we leave. The water taxi will take us back to Marco Polo, and we'll watch the city recede into the lagoon, already planning when we'll come back. Everyone says that about Venice. Everyone means it.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="prose">
                <p>The train from Venice to the Dolomites is one of those journeys where the destination keeps revealing itself in stages. First the flatlands of the Veneto, all vineyards and villas. Then the foothills, gentle rises that barely register. And then, suddenly, the mountains—not rising from the landscape but erupting from it, great vertical walls of pale dolomite that glow pink at sunrise and orange at sunset and impossible at all times.</p>

                <p>The Dolomites are not the Alps. They're older, stranger, more dramatic. These are the mountains that inspired Tolkien's Misty Mountains, that convinced Le Corbusier that nature could teach architecture, that make even the most jaded travelers stop mid-sentence and just stare. We're giving them four nights, split between two very different experiences.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="prose">
                <p>First, <strong>Cortina d'Ampezzo</strong>—the queen of the Dolomites, host of the 1956 Winter Olympics and the 2026 ones too. Cortina is glamorous in the way that old European resorts are glamorous: fur coats and Aperol Spritz, Italian families who've been coming here for generations, a main street where the shopping is as serious as the skiing. But we're not here for the scene. We're here for the <strong>Rosapetra Spa Resort</strong>, a refuge in the hills above town where the mountains fill every window and the thermal pools offer the kind of warmth that soaks into your bones and stays there for days.</p>

                <p>Two nights of spa, of silence, of letting the landscape do the work. Then we move to somewhere even more extraordinary.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="prose">
                <p><strong>Alpe di Siusi</strong> is Europe's largest alpine meadow—a high plateau of impossible beauty where the grass gives way to snow gives way to sky, and the peaks of the Sassolungo and Sciliar rise at the edges like the walls of some enormous natural cathedral. No cars are allowed up here. The air is so clean it almost hurts. The silence is the kind you can feel in your chest.</p>

                <p>The <strong>COMO Alpina Dolomites</strong> sits in the middle of this meadow, a hotel that somehow manages to be both luxurious and humble. The wellness programs are serious—COMO is known for them—but the real therapy is simpler: wake up, look out the window, remember that places like this exist.</p>

                <p>We'll hike to a <em>rifugio</em> for lunch—one of those mountain huts where they serve polenta and speck and wine that tastes better at altitude than it has any right to. We'll sit on a terrace carved into the snow and watch the peaks catch the afternoon light. And we'll understand, in that way you only understand in mountains, why people spend their whole lives chasing views like this.</p>

                <h2>Milan & Lake Como</h2>
                <p class="chapter-dates">January 17–23</p>
            </div>

            <div class="prose">
                <p>Milan is not a city that tries to charm you. Rome seduces, Florence dazzles, Venice enchants—but Milan just looks at you and waits for you to figure it out. It's a city of closed doors and hidden courtyards, of fashion houses and financial towers, of aperitivo bars where the Negronis are perfect and nobody seems impressed by anything.</p>

                <p>This is also where Italian design was invented. Not the Renaissance kind—the modern kind. The kind that gave us Gio Ponti and Achille Castiglioni, the Triennale and the Salone del Mobile, Kartell and Alessi and B&B Italia. Milan is where form and function learned to dance together, where everyday objects became worthy of museum collections, where "design" stopped being a specialty and became a way of seeing the world.</p>

                <p>We're staying in Ticinese, the neighborhood where the Milanese actually live—the Navigli canals, the vintage shops, the bars that haven't been discovered yet. Our apartment is on Corso di Porta Ticinese, a street that runs from the Roman columns at Piazza Vetra down to the canal district. Five nights. Enough time to stop feeling like tourists.</p>
            </div>

            </figure>

            <div class="prose">
                <p>The <strong>Fondazione Prada</strong> is the reason we're giving Milan five days. Rem Koolhaas transformed an old distillery into something that feels less like a museum and more like a small city dedicated to art—gold-leafed buildings, a "haunted house" by Robert Gober, a bar designed by Wes Anderson in shades of pink and green and formica. You could spend a full day here and still miss things. We'll have lunch at <strong>Bar Luce</strong>, Anderson's candy-colored café, and pretend we're in a film about people who are cooler than we are.</p>

                <p>The <strong>Pinacoteca di Brera</strong> is the old Milan—Renaissance masterpieces in a former Jesuit college, Raphael and Caravaggio and Piero della Francesca, the kind of collection that would be a national treasure anywhere else but here is just another Tuesday. The <strong>Duomo</strong> is the obvious Milan, but the roof terraces redeem it—two thousand statues and a forest of spires, the Alps visible on clear days, the whole city laid out below like a map of itself.</p>

                <p>And then there's <strong>The Last Supper</strong>. Leonardo's masterpiece, deteriorating on a convent wall in the western part of the city, visible only in fifteen-minute slots that must be booked months in advance. We have tickets for Tuesday morning. Fifteen minutes to stand in front of one of the most famous images in human history and try to see it fresh, to understand why it changed everything that came after it.</p>

                <p>On our last full day, we leave the city for <strong>Lake Como</strong>—that improbable body of water shaped like an inverted Y, surrounded by mountains and villas and the kind of beauty that makes you understand why George Clooney bought a house here. We'll take the train to Varenna first, a village so picturesque it looks CGI. Then the ferry to Bellagio, the pearl of the lake, for lunch and wandering. Then Como town and the funicular to Brunate for sunset—the lake laid out below us, the Alps beyond, the light doing things that light shouldn't be able to do.</p>

                <p>One night at the <strong>Hotel Villa Flori</strong>, a villa on the water. In the morning, we cross into Switzerland.</p>

                <p>Nine nights in Switzerland, split across five bases. It sounds scattered on paper, but there's a logic to it: we're following the mountains, the trains, and one very specific building.</p>

                <p>First, <strong>Wengen</strong>—a car-free village perched on a sunny terrace in the Bernese Oberland, facing the holy trinity of Swiss peaks: Eiger, Mönch, Jungfrau. No roads reach Wengen. You arrive by cog railway, your bags carried by electric cart, the 21st century fading behind you with every meter of altitude gained. Our apartment has a balcony. The view is the kind they put on chocolate boxes, except it's real and it's ours for three nights.</p>

            <div class="prose">
                <p>Weather permitting, we'll take the train to <strong>Jungfraujoch</strong>—the highest railway station in Europe, 3,454 meters above sea level, where you can walk on a glacier and pretend the whole thing isn't slightly absurd. If the clouds don't cooperate, there's always <strong>Männlichen</strong>, an easier summit with hiking even in January, or the <strong>Lauterbrunnen Valley</strong> below us—that narrow cleft in the mountains where waterfalls drop from cliffs so high they turn to mist before they hit the ground.</p>

                <p><strong>Lucerne</strong> is next—Switzerland's postcard town, the Chapel Bridge and the lake and the mountains rising behind. We're staying at the <strong>AMERON Hotel Flora</strong>, five minutes from everything. One day for the city itself, one day for <strong>Mount Rigi</strong>—the boat to Vitznau, the cogwheel train to the summit, lunch somewhere with a view that never ends. In the evening, maybe the <strong>Rosengart Collection</strong>: Picasso and Klee in a museum small enough to feel intimate.</p>

                <p>And then: <strong>Vals</strong>.</p>
            </div>

            </figure>

            <div class="prose">
                <p>Vals is a pilgrimage. Not for everyone—there's almost nothing there, a village of 1,000 people in a valley at the end of a road that goes nowhere else. But for those who care about architecture, about the way light moves through stone, about the idea that a building can be a kind of spiritual experience—Vals is essential.</p>

                <p>The <strong>Therme Vals</strong> is Peter Zumthor's masterpiece, widely considered one of the greatest buildings of the twentieth century. Sixty thousand slabs of local quartzite, layered like sedimentary rock, forming spaces for water and steam and silence. Indoor pools and outdoor pools, hot baths and cold plunges, a drinking fountain that dispenses water straight from the mountain. You move through it slowly, losing track of time, your body temperature rising and falling, the light shifting through narrow windows, the stone warm beneath your feet.</p>

                <p>The <strong>7132 Hotel</strong> wraps around the Therme. Guests get access before and after public hours—those early morning sessions when the pools are empty and the steam rises through shafts of alpine light. We have two nights. We will spend most of them in the water.</p>

                <p>Vals is a pilgrimage. Not for everyone. But for those who care about architecture—essential.</p>

                <p>From Vals, we descend to <strong>Basel</strong>—Switzerland's art city, home to the Kunstmuseum and the Beyeler Foundation and, just across the German border, the <strong>Vitra Design Museum</strong> campus. One night at the <strong>Volkshaus</strong>, a Herzog & de Meuron renovation of a historic building. One day of museums: Vitra's architecture tour in the morning, <strong>Fondation Beyeler</strong> in the afternoon—Renzo Piano's building in a park, one of Europe's great collections of modern art.</p>

                <p>Then <strong>Zürich</strong>, briefly. One night at the <strong>B2 Hotel</strong>, a former brewery turned design hotel. Morning at the <strong>Fraumünster</strong> to see Chagall's stained glass windows, those impossible blues and greens that look like they're lit from within. And then the airport. And then London.</p>

                <p>London is the exhale. After five weeks of foreign languages and unfamiliar rhythms, of navigating train stations and decoding menus, of being slightly lost all the time in the best possible way—London is where we land. A city we know. A language we share. A chance to process everything we've seen before we fly home.</p>

                <p>Six nights. No fixed plans. The great London museums are all free: the <strong>Tate Modern</strong> in the Bankside power station, the <strong>V&A</strong> with its endless rooms of beautiful objects, the <strong>British Museum</strong> where every empire eventually ends up donating its treasures. We'll pick and choose based on weather and energy, based on what feels right each morning over coffee.</p>

                <p><strong>Borough Market</strong> for lunch one day, pushing through crowds to find the cheese guy, the oyster bar, the Turkish bakery. <strong>Dover Street Market</strong> for fashion treated as art. <strong>Liberty</strong> for the building itself, that Tudor revival department store with its creaking floors and fabric department that could swallow an afternoon. Maybe a show in the West End. Maybe afternoon tea somewhere ridiculous.</p>

                <p>Our last dinner will be somewhere we love. <strong>Dishoom</strong> for the nostalgia of Bombay cafés. <strong>Hawksmoor</strong> for the kind of steak that makes you forget you've been eating polenta and pasta for a month. <strong>Bao</strong> if we want something that feels like the future.</p>

                <p>And then Heathrow. And then the overnight flight. And then Mexico City in the morning, and everything that comes next.</p>
